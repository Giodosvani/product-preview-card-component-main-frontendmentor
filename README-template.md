## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to use the ```<section>``` tag in HTML. With it, we can set media queries for different type of images withou creating divs that load, but are invisible on the css. It is a simple case, so you may not notice the difference, but it faster and better optimized to your server and final client to load your website.

I've learned about the CSS propertie: ````letter-spacing``` in CSS. It spaces the letter of a word, and i used it to write the "P E R F U M E" in the top of the card.

### Continued development

I want to still use and learn more about semantic HTML and how to optimize your website.
